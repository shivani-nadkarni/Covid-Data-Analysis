# Global Covid Data Analysis
This project focuses on analysing COVID cases, deaths and vaccination trends in countries accross the globe.

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to use methodologies like data analysis and data visualisation to understand trends and patterns of COVID-19 cases, vaccinations and deaths. 
Data analysis helps to quickly grasp the rise/fall, degree of spread, intensity, etc of cases. Visualisations helps to tell this story using visual elements (charts/maps), and this fact helps stakeholders - in this case National Governments, International communities, local structures - to arrive at conclusions. This conclusion further leads to actions that help to alleviate the problems.
